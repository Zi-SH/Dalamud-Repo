# Dalamud Repository

**Please note that plugins contained in this repository are not reviewed for safety, nor do I personally condone their use. Install at your own risk.**


A collection of third-party Dalamud Repositories, merged into a single file for easy browsing.

This list is automatically updated:
- Every 30 minutes `ffxiv_custom_repo.json` will refresh changes to individual plugins
- Every 10 minutes outdated plugins will be checked for updates
- Every day invalid (broken) plugin downloads will be rechecked

Special thanks to Akurosia, who originally pioneered this [idea](https://github.com/Akurosia/MyCustomDalamudPluginRepoCollection).
